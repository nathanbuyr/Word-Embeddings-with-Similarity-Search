Version: Java 17

## Description

This is a console-based Java application that allows users to perform similarity searches using word embeddings.

The application reads a user-specified `.txt` file containing words and their corresponding vector values (e.g., GloVe-style word embeddings). Users can then select a word, and the system returns the most similar words based on cosine similarity.

## How to Run

1. Compile or navigate to the JAR file directory.
2. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
java -cp ./dsa.jar ie.atu.sw.Runner
```

3. Follow the menu prompts to:
   - Load an embedding file.
   - Set an output file directory (optional).
   - Choose a word to search.
   - Select the number of similar words to display.
   - Choose the sorting order (most to least similar or vice versa).

> ðŸ”¸ If no output file is specified, the default is `./out.txt`.  
> ðŸ”¸ If no embedding file is selected, the search feature will not be available.

## Features

- Load a custom text file containing word embeddings.
- Search for a specific word in the embedding space.
- Choose the number of most similar words to output.
- Save results to a specified output file.
- Option to sort results from most to least similar (or vice versa).
- Uses cosine similarity to compare word vectors.
